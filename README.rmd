# LicensePlateBlur

## Description
This script uses a YOLO model to automatically detect and blur license plates in images within a specified folder. It was created out of necessity and is shared in case it might be useful to someone.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Ultralytics YOLO

To install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install opencv-python opencv-python-headless ultralytics
```

## Usage
Run the script by specifying the folder containing the images:
```sh
python blur_license_plates.py --folder_path "path/to/folder"
```
The script will save the modified images in an output folder (`Output_2` by default).

## Repository Structure
- `blur_license_plates.py`: Main script for license plate detection and blurring.
- `license_plate_detector.pt`: YOLO model for license plate detection (not included, must be downloaded separately).

## Notes
The code is provided "as is" without any guarantees of accuracy or performance. It can be improved or adapted as needed.
